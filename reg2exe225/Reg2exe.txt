Please unregister any previous version of Reg2Exe older than 2.02

About / What is Reg2exe
-----------------------

Reg2exe opens reg-files and "creates" a exe file which will, when executed,
import all settings whithin this reg-file to the windows regestry.

If you don't know Reg-files are, or what the windows regestry is, you should
better not use reg2exe (yet).

Of course reg-files / REGEDIT do the same as reg2exe / created exe-files.
  Pro reg-files / REGEDIT:
    - You can check what you import and easily modify
    - Warns before importing
    - No need for msvbvm60.dll
    - Smaller size on small files, can be imported in DOS mode
  Pro reg2exe / exe-files:
    - Can't be modified such easily
    - No more warnings / messages (so be careful !)
    - No need for regedit.exe
    - Does not create a key when deleting from a key that not exists
      (New feature in 2.10, not REGEDIT4 compatible)
    - Smaller size for larger files
    - Allowes relative path (new feature in 2.10, not REGEDIT4 compatible)

As long there are bugs or requests, Reg2exe is under development. The latest
official version can be found at http://www.ctuser.net. For suggestions,
questions, requests or bug reports, send eMail to info@ctuser.net.
  
Reg2exe has now approximate 95b / compressed 35kb. The source code &
resources take about 85kb (1400 lines / 22kb pure code) + 11KB (364 lines / 8kb
pure code)

This document will give you additional information of Reg2exe

System requirements
-------------------
(according to Microsoft)
- Pentium 90MHz / high
- VGA 640x480 or higher
- 24MB RAM for Windows 95 / 32MB for Windows NT.
- Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 / 95 or later.
  (Windows 95 users may need DCOM update (or at least one file of)


Programm overview
-----------------

 - Installing: Copy reg2exe where you want to keep it. Start reg2exe, click
               "Register". Quit reg2exe now. Whenever you move reg2exe.exe,
               you'll have to register again.
   You should unregister any previous version of Reg2Exe older than 2.02 first

 - Converting (Explorer): Select the reg-file you want to convert, then press
                          the right mouse button to open the file popup menu.
                          Choose "Convert to EXE" now.

 - Removing: Run reg2exe. Click "Unregister". Quit reg2exe. Now you can remove
             any copy of reg2exe (2.x) (If Reg2exe was registered from within
             another folder, you may have to register first, and unregister to
             remove it from the file popup meu)

 - Converting without installing (Windows): Drag your reg-file on reg2exe

 - Converting without installing (DOS-Box): Type: REG2EXE <regfile>
                                        e.g.: c:\Test\reg2exe c:\Test\Custom.reg


Enhanced regestry
-----------------

[-HKEY_...] Deletes entire key and all subkeys / values (Regedit compatible)
            You need do create it again using [HKEY...] for writting values, if
            required.
[&HKEY_...] Opens a key without creating. If the key does not exist, further
            values are not written
            (Reg2exe 2.10 / higher)
[*HKEY_...] Deletes all subkeys of the specified key, and all values in the
            subkeys. Does not delete values in the key itself;
            The key is left open for writting values
            (Reg2exe 2.24 / higher)
[?HKEY_...] Deletes all values in the specified key. Does not delete any subkeys
            or values within the subkeys
            The key is left open for writting values
            (Reg2exe 2.24 / higher)

Following strings within the data (value) block are replaced with the matching
absolute path:
    <Reg2exePath>         Directory where executable is executed
    <Reg2exeWinPath>      Windows directory
    <Reg2exeSysPath>      Windows system / system32 directory
    <Reg2exeTempPath>     Windows temp directory
    <Reg2exeProgsPath>    Programs directory

Version history
---------------

New: New feature
Bug: Essential bugfix (Programm hangs, ...)
Fix: Other bugfix (Display, ...)
Chg: Changes (Optimation, ...)
Del: Removed 'feature' (Automation, ...)
Lng: Language related fix/change

(Some bugs may not affect the previous version, but an unreleased pre-beta
version)

2.25
 - Bug: 'File damaged' error on some converted files
 - Fix: <Reg2exe...> stuff not working
 - Fix: quotes in commandline working
 - Add: Simple GUI for progress indication
 - Chg: Slightly improved conversation performance, at cost of some memory and
        delay before and after conversation itself
 - Chg: Slightly improved (faster) pre-conversation regestry data preperation

2.24
 - Fixed: Manually deleting keys / subkeys recursively (Win2k/XP compatibility)
          (Thanks to Arno Menningmann for reporting)
 - Added [*HKEY_...] (Deletes all subkeys of the specified key)
 - Added [?HKEY_...] (Deletes all values in the specified key)

2.23
 - Fixed: Program path detection fixed (Regestry read string procedure)

2.22
 - Now published under the GNU General Public License
 - Fixed <Reg2exePath> not replaced with matching path when lengths were equal
 - Added <Reg2exeWinPath>, <Reg2exeSysPath>, <Reg2exeTempPath> and
   <Reg2exeProgsPath> (replaced in data with the matching absolute path)
 - Another check if regestry data offset in converted exe-files really are
   regestry data to prevent modified converted exe-files from importing
   'nonsens' data
 - Converted executable supports @= (deletes / clears the 'default' value
   (Regsnap 1 compatibility)

2.21
 - XP Skinning support
 - Created exes no longer showing 'beta 2'

2.20
 - Warn when overwriting non-reg2exe exefiles on conversation
 - Writing to file error due file attributes no longer shows visual basic stan-
   dard error message, but error message in progress bar control.
 - Fixed bug when deleting an item ("Sourcedir"=-)
 - 'REG-file not found' error instead of 'REG-file contains no data' when file
   does not exist
 - Rewritten 'selfreg.exe' in PureBasic
   -> Your created exe's need no longer msvbvm60.dll
   -> Way faster and just ~0.5 KB more size currently
 - Added support for writing values in a [-HKEY... key (Automatically creates
   and opens the folder after deleting when containing items; Have seen such
   a regestry file a few days ago the first time...)
 - Now writing to top-keys is supported; Regedit supports it, so do I now.

2.10
 - Optimized code, compiling to P-code > smaller exefiles (Saves about 0.5 kb
   for Exe-files) (Immense source code optimations, but only saving some bytes)
 - Win2000/XP Reg-files support (as long as there are no real unicode characters
   used) by different way of processing the source (REG) file
 - Value may contain <REG2EXEPATH> which will be replaced with the path the
   programm is started from
 - Support for dragging files onto dialog.
 - Regestry key is not specified when adding items to a key, now can save 2
   bytes for each item/key, and len(key) bytes for each item
 - Added [&HKEY_... support; Same as [HKEY_..., but does not create the key.
   So if the key is not found, it will not be created, nor will any items
   created/deleted
 - Some data structure changes saving another 2 bytes for each key or dword item
   and one byte each non-dword item. Key maximum length is still at 65535 bytes,
   items have a shared maximum length of 1048575 bytes for name and data
   (previously 65535 bytes for name and 65535 bytes for data)
 - Remmoved 2-Color icon (saves another 0.5 kb for Exe-files)

2.02
 - Optimized code, much smaller (Saves about 8.5 kb for Exe-Files)
 - Compressed
 - Using standart resources
 - Smart registration
 - Created EXE-file display information when specifying any parameter
 - Modified format

2.01
 - This README.TXT file
 - HKEY_USERS, HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, HKEY_DYN_DATA support
   (So I'm not sure anyone use these)
 - \\, \" support (argh, I hated this. Hope it works at ANY conditions)
 - hex(...) support. I don't know why Microsoft enabled this and why they use it
   for a few settings (Internet Explorer stores 2 Settings with hex(...) nor why
   support hex(256) and above.
 - When creating a new folder, the default node is no longer set to a nullstring
   (Shouldn't matter, but shouldn't be. E.g. a "noname" connection may have
   appeared when importing dial-up settings)

2.00 (First release)

(1) needs msvbvm60.dll for created executable to work (~ 1.2 MB), for
    Windows 95 users also an Ole update
(2) slighly increased from 2.20 to 2.21 due XP skinning support

Known problems, Behaviours, Bugs, Errors, Problems
--------------------------------------------------

Of course I'm testing my software and find most errors myself. Additionally, a
good friend of mine tests any version (alpha, pre-beta, beta, ...).
If you find an error anyway (that's why it's a beta), try to find out what you
did that caused the error (bug) and find the fastest / easiest way to reproduce
this error and eMail your report (info@ctuser.net). Please also check if the
error depends on one or more settings
